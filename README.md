# my-big-project
This is my big project that I started to build on 27/12/2020, around month and 20 days after I started to learn programming.

It's simple site made completly from HTML and CSS, only little JavaScript because at the time I still didn't start to learn JS. I think it look's nice, of course it's fully responsive. It has a map included, and nice loading animations. It's not too much, but you have to start somewhere.
